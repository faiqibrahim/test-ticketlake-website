                                <strong>13. YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS. </strong>Under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“<b>CCPA</b>”), California residents have certain rights regarding our collection, use and
                                sharing of personal information.  We do not sell your personal information and will not do so in the future without providing you with notice and an opportunity to opt-out of such sale, as required by law.
                                We do not offer financial incentives associated with our collection, use or disclosure of your personal information.
                                <div className={'marginTop30px'}>
                                    We collect various categories of personal information when you use the Site that may include but not be limited to identifiers, commercial information and internet or other electronic network or device
                                    activity information. A more detailed description of the information we collect and how we use it is provided above in Section 3. Sections 4 and 5 describe the categories of third parties, if any, with
                                    whom we share personal information and what information may be shared under different circumstances.

                                    If you are a resident of California, you have the right to request to know what personal information has been collected about you and to access that information. You also have the right to request deletion
                                    of your personal information, though exceptions under the CCPA may allow us to retain and use certain personal information notwithstanding your deletion request.  You may also send your request by email
                                    to info@Ticketlake.com or through regular mail to 1200 Spruce Street, Berkeley, California 94709. We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under the CCPA. An agent may submit a request
                                    on your behalf, but you must verify that your agent is authorized to do so.

                                    Separate from the CCPA, California's “Shine the Light” law (Civil Code Section § 1798.83) permits users of our Site that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal
                                    information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an email to info@Ticketlake.com.
